2. We want to see if the website is intuitive to navigate.

Make sure to observe the users emotions as well as listening to what they say. NOTE BOTH!

Make the subject open the website and ask the following questions.
(In parenthesis is the reason for asking the question above.
Do not say this out loud. It's no secret, but it might color the subjects answer.
You can however use this information to ask improvised follow-up questions depending on where the conversation goes)
